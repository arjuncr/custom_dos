;*TE PATCH                       
;      CtrlC at DosInput (like C:>DATE does) 
;      Nukes the Kernel.
;      
;      it looks like ENTRY.ASM+PROCSUPT.ASM
;      got out of sync.
;      
;      spawn_int() assumes a stack layout at
;      usr_ss:usr:sp. but usr:ss currently contains 0
;      
;      this patch helps FreeDos to survive CtrlC,
;      but should clearly be done somehow else.
